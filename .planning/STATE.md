# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-25)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: FalkorDB for graph + vector storage (no separate vector DB needed)
- [Init]: Gemini 2.5 Flash for reasoning + embeddings via google-genai 1.x SDK
- [Init]: Single agent harness with role-specific prompts (not separate implementations)
- [Init]: LLM-defined graph schema — no hardcoded entity or relationship types
- [Research]: Disambiguation gate (alias → fuzzy → LLM) must ship in Phase 2 from day one — cannot be added retroactively

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research flag — Phase 2]: Fuzzy similarity threshold needs empirical calibration during Phase 2 planning
- [Research flag — Phase 4]: Heat/salience decay functions and theme merging strategy need a planning spike before Phase 4
- [Research flag — Phase 5]: RAGAS 0.4.x Gemini config override is non-default — verify exact pattern before Phase 5 implementation
- [Infra gap]: Confirm pulled FalkorDB Docker image version supports native vector indexes before Phase 1 closes
